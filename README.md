# Remaining time prediction in Business Processes using LSTMs
For this assignment i used the BPI 2012 Challenge dataset and the reference paper N. Navarin, B. Vincenzi, M. Polato and A. Sperduti, "LSTM networks for data-aware remaining time prediction of business process instances," 2017 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI), Honolulu, HI, USA, 2017, pp. 1-7, doi: 10.1109/SSCI.2017.8285184.

I included a zipped copy of the dataset and also a well commented jupyter notebook, as to make this repo self sufficient, barring the necessary libraries like `pm4py`.
